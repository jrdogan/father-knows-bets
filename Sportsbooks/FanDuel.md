# [FanDuel](https://nc.sportsbook.fanduel.com/)
FanDuel is the second site that I created a sportsbook account at. In general, it has superior or competitive odds on most sports, and attractive promotions. I believe I have placed the most wagers at this sportsbook since I started.
## Observations
- Unlike some other books, FD Bonus Bets cannot be split across multiple wagers.
## Promotions
- Bet Protect: If one of the players in your wager gets injured (the timing of the injury varies depending on the sport), and your bet would have otherwise won, receive cash credit (for a single) or have that leg of the wager voided (for parlays).
- Deposit Bonus: Occasionally a deposit bonus may be offered. The typical bonus is awarded as bonus bets credited to your account.
- Touchdown Jackpot: Place an anytime TD wager on a player, and if they score the first or last TD of the game, share a large bonus bet pool with other wagerers who made the same wager.
## Rewards System
None that I know of. The offered odds and promotions are good enough that no rewards system is necessary.
## Contests
- [[FanDuel Contest - F2P The Daily Play|The Daily Play]]  - Free to Play (available during MLB and NFL regular seasons)
