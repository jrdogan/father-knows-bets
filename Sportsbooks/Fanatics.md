# Fanatics
Fanatics is one of the only sportsbooks that I use that does not have a web interface. It only exists as a mobile app on Android and iOS.
## Observations
- Fanatics consists of 2 separate mobile apps. There is the sportsbook app where you can place wagers, and there is the general Fanatics app where you can purchase merchandise/tickets and play free contests.
## Promotions
- 
## Rewards System
Each cash wager placed earns FanCash which can be used to buy merchandise at the Fanatics store, or converted to bonus bets.
## Contests
- [[Fanatics Contest - Fanatics 5 Daily|Fanatics 5 Daily]] - Free to Play (available all year)
