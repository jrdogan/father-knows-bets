# [DraftKings](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/)
DraftKings is the first site that I created an account at, as I created a DFS account back before the sportsbook was launched in North Carolina.
## Observations
- Unlike some other books, DK Bonus Bets cannot be split across multiple wagers.
## Promotions
- Deposit Bonus: Occasionally a deposit bonus may be offered. The typical bonus is awarded as bonus bets credited to your account.
- Early Exit: If one of the players in your wager gets injured (the timing of the injury varies depending on the sport), and your bet would have otherwise won, receive cash credit (for a single) or have that leg of the wager voided (for parlays).
- Ghost Leg Parlay: This will void any single losing leg of a parlay, so if you have a parlay that only has 1 losing leg, this turns it into a winning parlay.
- No Sweat: If your wager loses, receive a bonus bet.
- Parlay Profit Boost: A standard profit boost that can be applied to parlay, SGP and SGP(x) wagers.
- Stepped Up Parlay: Adds a profit boost to a parlay wager which increases based on how many legs are in the parlay.
- Referrals: 100% deposit match payable as a single bonus bet up to $100.
## Rewards System
- [Crowns](https://support.draftkings.com/dk/en-us/crowns-overview?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010399) are slowly earned based on the types of wagers you make. Crowns have no cash value but can be convered to DK Dollars.
- [DK Dollars](https://support.draftkings.com/dk/en-us/what-are-dk-dollars?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010451) can be used as cash in wagers, but cannot be withdrawn from your account. If you place a cash wager while you have DK Dollars on your account, the DK Dollars are applied before using any actual cash.
