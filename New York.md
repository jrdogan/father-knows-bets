Something to chew on when you find yourself in NY... I've listed the books I use in the order that I think the promos would benefit you. I think I understand them fairly well but those legalese sections can be tricky!  
  
**DraftKings Sportsbook**  
New User Promo (expires 9/7 but likely extended): Create an account and make a $5+ wager. Receive $300 in bonus bets and a promo code for $200 off of NFL Sunday Ticket, whether the initial wager wins or loses. Bonus paid as 12 $25 bonus bets that are valid for 7 days.  
Referral Promo (expires 9/10 but likely extended): If you use a referral link when signing up and deposit $25+, then you and the referrer each receive a single bonus bet valid for 7 days that is equal to the size of the deposit, up to $100.  
  
**FanDuel Sportsbook**  
New User Promo: Create an account and deposit $5+ into it. Your first cash wager must be $5+. If that wager wins, you receive $300 in bonus bets. There is no mention of any minimum odds, so you could make a -10000 odds bet to better ensure that you get the bonus bets.  
Referral Promo: If you use a referral link when signing up, deposit $5+, and then place a $5+ bet, then the referrer receives $50 in bonus bets that are valid for 7 days. THIS IS UNUSUAL, AS YOU GET NO BENEFIT!  
  
**Caesars Sportsbook**  
New User Promo: Bet $1 and receive 20 100% profit boosts usable on any sport. Boosts are valid for 14 days. Max Wager/boost is $25.  
Referral Promo: If you use a referral link when signing up, deposit $50+ into your account, and wager at least $50 in total within 90 days of account creation (doesn't have to all be in 1 bet), then you and the referrer each receive 5 $10 bonus bets that are valid for 30 days.  
  
**Fanatics Sportsbook**  
New User Promo: I can't find one, but might be because I am not in NY.  
Referral Promo (active through October): If you use a referral link when signing up and wager $20+ in cumulative cash wagers, then you and the referrer each receive $100 of FanCash (which is convertible to bonus bets).  
  
Looks like NY doesn't have ESPNBet or Bet365 books yet. I like them both, but only for certain things.

Basically  

- DraftKings - use referral link, deposit $100. You end up with $400 in bonus bets and $200 off Sunday Ticket.  
- FanDuel - use referral link to be nice to me. Deposit $5 and get $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins.  
- Caesars - use referral link, deposit $50. Wager $50 and get $50 of bonus and 20 100% profit boost tokens.  
- Fanatics - use referral link, bet $20 on anything and get $100 of bonus.
