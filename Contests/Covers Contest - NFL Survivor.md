- Entry Fee: Free to Play
- What: Compete in a traditional NFL survivor pool over the course of the regular season. If the team wins, you can continue to play the next week. Each team can only be selected once over the course of the contest. Lose and you are out!
- When: Select a team each week prior to the start of that team's game.
- Where: Log in to the [Covers NFL Survivor Page](https://freeplay.covers.com/survivor-games/nfl-survivor/) using your Covers account. You can register a new account [here](https://www.covers.com/account/register), but I chose to just link my Google account so I don't have a separate login to keep track of.
- Why: It is a winner-take-all $10,000 contest. If there are multiple survivors at the end of the season, the prize is split amongst all remaining contestants.

- I recommend using [Survivor Grid](https://www.survivorgrid.com/) to plan your picks as the season progresses.
