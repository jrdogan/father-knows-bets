- What: Try to build the longest win streak you can by making a moneyline or over/under pick from a list of available games across various leagues. If your pick wins, your win streak grows by one. If your pick loses, your win streak count is reset to zero.
- When: You may only make one pick per day. If you go more than seven days between picks, your win streak resets back to zero.
- Where: Log in to the [Covers Streak Survivor Page](https://contests.covers.com/survivor) using your Covers account. You can register a new account [here](https://www.covers.com/account/register), but I chose to just link my Google account so I don't have a separate login to keep track of.
