Pikkit is a freemium tool that allows you to link your sportsbook accounts and manage wagers across different sportsbooks.

## Features
- #### Track Your Performance 
	- On the home page, click the Sync button to sync all of your accounts to Pikkit. This feature sometimes takes a few minutes to reflect changes within Pikkit, and sometimes it takes several sync attempts to work properly.
	- At a glance, see how many bets you have today, broken down into open, live and settled, along with profit/loss amount.
	- View your cash balance at each of your sportsbook accounts, along with a grand total.
	- Click on the Calendar to view your daily/monthly profit or loss across all sites. Click on a day to see which bets settled on that day.
- #### Odds Shopping
	- Click on the Events menu to find the best odds on a given wager across all the books that you have linked to Pikkit, as well as other sportsbooks.
- #### Social Betting
	- Follow trusted bettors and get notified when they place bets.
	- Earn badges for various achievements.

## Issues/Limitations
- [[Bet365]] sportsbook account authentication has an issue that causes it to send a verification code every time you sync it with Pikkit. Because of this, I usually leave my Bet365 account sync disabled unless I know that I have a bet that I want to sync. I will then enable it briefly, sync, and then disable it again.
- In the free version, you can only view the most recent 2 months in the calendar view.
