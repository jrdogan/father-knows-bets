# [Bet365](https://www.nc.bet365.com/)
Bet365 is the king of free contests, and they have a generous early payout policy.
## Observations
- Bet365 Bonus Bets can be split across multiple wagers. They are treated as a bonus bet pool that you can use to apply as little or as much as you like to each individual wager.
- Bonus Bets expire 7 days after being issued. But if you earn additional bonus bets (usually through one of the free contests), that causes the expiration date of the entire bonus bet pool to be extended to 7 days after the current date.
- (Unconfirmed) Same Game Parlays (SGPs) require at least 2 legs. If you have a promo that requires you to use it on a Baseball SGP, you can sometimes add 1+ RBI, 1+ run and 4+ total bases to bypass that requirement, and often pays out higher odds than betting 1+ HR.

## Promotions
- Early Payout: This promotion considers a moneyline wager to be a winner if the team gets ahead by a certain margin (varies by sport) at any point during the contest. It applies to both straight bets and parlays. The early payout margin for each league/sport is as follows:
	- Soccer: 2 goal lead
	- MLB: 5 run lead
	- NFL: 17 point lead
	- NCAAF: 17 point lead
	- CFL: 17 point lead
	- WNBA: 18 point lead
- Super Boost: Frequently, there are "Super Boost" promotions that appear on the main Sports page. These are pre-built wagers that have a boosted payout and are often +EV.
## Rewards System
None that I know of. The number of free to play contests and early payouts are good enough that no rewards system is necessary.
