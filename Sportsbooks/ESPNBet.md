# [ESPNBet](https://espnbet.com/login)
ESPN typically doesn't have any daily free to play activities, but it does have deposit bonuses from time to time.
## Observations
- If you want to watch an NFL game and don't otherwise have access to it (if it's being broadcast on a channel you don't want to pay for), you can view the game on the ESPNBet app on your phone if you have an active wager on it.
## Promotions
- Bet Protect: If one of the players in your wager gets injured (the timing of the injury varies depending on the sport), and your bet would have otherwise won, receive cash credit (for a single) or have that leg of the wager voided (for parlays).
- Early Payout: On occasion, an early payout promo will be in effect. This promotion considers a moneyline wager to be a winner if the team gets ahead by a certain margin (varies by sport) at any point during the contest. It applies to both straight bets and parlays. The early payout margin for each league/sport is as follows:
	- NFL: 15 point lead
- Deposit Bonus: Occasionally a deposit bonus may be offered. The typical bonus is awarded as bonus bets credited to your account.
- Injury Insurance: If one of the players in your NFL wager gets injured in the 1st half and ruled out of the 2nd half, and your bet would have otherwise won, receive cash credit (for a single) or have that leg of the wager voided (for parlays).
- 3 HR Protection: If you place a moneyline MLB wager and the team you picked loses but hits 3+ home runs in the game, you are awarded a bonus bet equal to 100% of your wager, up to $100.
- NFL OT Protection: If you place a moneyline NFL wager and the team you picked loses in OT, you are awarded a bonus bet equal to 100% of your wager, up to $1000.
- Referrals: If someone signs up using your referral link and deposits $25+ and makes a single wager of $25+, both of you get $50 in bonus bets.
