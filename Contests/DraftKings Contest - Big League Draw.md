Note: If you are able to ensure that you will be paying attention, It is best to hold off on making your daily selection until you get close to the cutoff time. If you don't, the algorithm has a higher chance of selecting a player that is not starting today. But if you are not sure, it is best to just go ahead and make your selection - better to risk the small chance of selecting an inactive player than to risk forgetting to make the pick at all!
