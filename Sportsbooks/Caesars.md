# [Caesars](https://sportsbook.caesars.com/us/nc/bet)
Caesars typically doesn't have the best odds or promotions, but they do just enough to keep me active.
## Observations
- 
## Promotions
- Birthday Bonus: Receive a $10 bonus bet on your birthday!
- Million Dollar Parlay Payday: Opt in, and if you make a  $5+ NFL parlay, SGP or SGPX with 3+ legs and +5000 or higher odds for that week's games, receive a share of a $50,000 bonus bet pool for each winning qualifying wager.
- Fastball Fortune: Opt in, and if you make a $5+ MLB parlay, SGP or SGPx with 3+ legs and +400 or higher odds for that week's games, you are eligible to receive a share of the jackpot if a no-hitter is thrown by any pitcher that week. Week runs from Monday to Sunday. Your wager does not have to win to qualify.
- 50 Burger: Opt in, and if you make a $5+ NFL SGP with 3+ legs and +100 or higher odds for that week's games, you are eligible to receive a share of the jackpot if either team involved in the SGP scores 50+ points. The Week 1 Jackpot starts at $50,000 and $50,000 is added to the jackpot each week. If no team scores 50 points during a week, then the jackpot is rolled over to the following week. Any game involving a team that scores 50 points will result in the jackpot being awarded to all qualifying bets and the jackpot being reset to $50,000 the following week.
- Referrals: If someone signs up using your referral link and deposits $50+ and makes wagers totalling $50+, both of you get $50 issued as five $10 bonus bets.
## Rewards System
The rewards system is tied to the Caesars Rewards program. Each reward credit is worth $0.01 which can be applied directly to a wager.
