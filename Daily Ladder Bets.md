Ladder Contest Rules:
1. Maximum one bet/day.
2. Overall odds on each bet should be between -120 and +200 (or 5/6 and 2/1 for Calvin).
3. Bets can cover any sport. Use of promotions is allowed and encouraged.
4. The ladder starts at Rung 1, with an initial bet amount of $2.00.
5. The ladder consists of 5 rungs. Winning bets advance you to the next ladder rung. Losing bets drop you back to Rung 1.
6. Funding of ladder bets uses the following progression:
	1. Rung 1 - 1 unit ($2 for me) is the bet amount of any Rung 1 bet
	2. Rung 2 - The bet amount equals the payout of the winning Rung 1 bet
	3. Rung 3 -	The bet amount equals the payout of the winning Rung 2 bet, minus 1 unit which is used to fund future ladder bets
	4. Rungs 4 and 5 -The bet amount equals the payout of the winning Rung 3 bet, minus 2 units which is used to fund future ladder bets
7. Rung 5 is the final rung. Win or lose, start the next ladder at Rung 1. Don't get greedy!
